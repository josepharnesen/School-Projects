This repository is for all my school projects. 

**IS_115_Final_Project:**
  
  In this project I used python code to automate data cleaning and univariate and bivariate statistics and visualizations. The data I used was data about wildfires in the Northeastern part of Portugal. My hope was to determine which factors contributed to larger wildfires (by area). Unfortunately, my analysis showed that none of the variables that I was working with significanly affected the area of a wildfire. 
  
  I suggest in the my report that further analysis should be done perhaps using multiple linear regression or time series modeling.
